Here's how to format Python code on Discord:
\`\`\`py
print('Hello World!')
\`\`\`
These are backticks, not quotes. Check [this](https://superuser.com/questions/254076/how-do-i-type-the-tick-and-backtick-characters-on-windows/254077#254077) out if you can't find the backtick key on your keyboard.

long_code = """**Pasting long lines of code**
If the code is too long to fit in a codeblock in discord, you can paste your code here:
https://paste.pydis.com/

After pasting your code, save it by clicking the 'Save' (or CTRL+S) button on the top right. After doing that, copy the new URL and post it here so others can see it.
